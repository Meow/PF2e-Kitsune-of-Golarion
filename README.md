# PF2e Kitsune of Golarion

Become a true trickster fox with hundreds of new options for Kitsune characters! Cast spells in your fox form, steal faces to craft magical masks, empower your foxfire to be a potent primary weapon, and much more!

This module contains the **Kitsune of Golarion** content from Everybody Games (https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/product/381454/Kitsune-of-Golarion). This initial release is the base book, with more books in this series to be added later. It includes new heritages, ancestry feats, equipment, and archetypes! It also includes alternate rules for Kitsune shape change and 'reforged' versions of stock Kitsune feats to bring them more in line with the tricksters of lore.
